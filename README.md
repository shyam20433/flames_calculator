## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Make sure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or higher)
3. Install Flask:
   ```bash
   pip install flask

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

3. Enter two names and click "Calculate" to see the relationship result!

## How FLAMES Works

1. **Remove Common Letters**: Take both names and remove all common letters
2. **Count Remaining Letters**: Count the total remaining letters
3. **FLAMES Elimination**: Starting from F, count the remaining letters and eliminate letters from FLAMES
4. **Final Result**: The last remaining letter determines the relationship type

### Example:
- Name 1: "JOHN"
- Name 2: "JANE"
- Common letters: J, A, N
- Remaining: O, H, E
- Count: 3
- FLAMES elimination: F, L, A, M, E, S ‚Üí F, L, M, E, S ‚Üí F, L, M, S ‚Üí F, L, S ‚Üí F, S ‚Üí F
- Result: **Friends**
